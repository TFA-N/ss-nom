This mod adds a new faction, _The Nomads,_ to the game with custom ships and weapons. They are universally hostile, except to the player and the other neutral or independent factions. The _Armada Fleet_ will depart from the _Nur_ system and journey around the sector for as long as it can. If, however, the _Oasis_ is destroyed, the escort fleets will scatter. The _Oasis_ is available for sale during the brief period following its destruction, from the station in the _Nur._ It also adds some demo missions to allow for a quick preview of the content.
