Market",pirates,"The black market. Anything and everything can be bought or sold, and there are no tariffs.

However, transactions may catch the eye of authorities, and large-volume trade may empower local crime syndicates, undermine legitimate authority, and destabilize the overall market. Selling (but not buying) commodities that are illegal on the open market has a much greater impact on stability.

Black market transactions are also less likely to be found out about by the enemies of the faction controlling the market.

More goods are available for sale if the market's stability is low.

Trading with the transponder off and engaging in legitimate trade as a ""cover"" both reduce the probability of attracting the attention of authorities.",com.fs.starfarer.api.impl.campaign.submarkets.BlackMarketPlugin,graphics/factions/black_market.png,999
