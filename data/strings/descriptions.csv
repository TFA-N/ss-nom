nom_ant,SHIP,"Ants are light and cheap to build, and most effectively deployed as short-range scouts. Due to their fragility and outdated design relative to post-Domain standards, Ant wings do not serve well as fighter screens.",,,
nom_iguana,SHIP,"Iguana have unusually high flux capacity, but with a crew requirement to match. They are classed as Corvettes, yet fly in three-ship wings and can be field-refitted like fighters.",,,
nom_wurm,SHIP,"If any Domain citizen has ever seen a Nomad vessel in detail, chances are it would be a Wurm-class assault frigate. This staple design carries with it all of the core Nomad military virtues: short and powerful electron masers, relatively decent armor, and maintenance so simple that the vessel is almost self-sufficient. Wurms are the general-purpose ships in the Nomad fleet, serving as padding and filler for the various specialized or larger components of a combined-arms fleet. The threat of a single Wurm is near non-existent, akin to that of a shield-equipped Hound or Cerebus piloted by an over-ambitious rebel. However, when operated with the support of other ships, the prospect of being flanked and pounded into scrap becomes a grave concern. Commanders are reminded that masers were obsoleted due to their flux inefficiency and generally short range, but are otherwise just as devastating as Tritachyon pulse lasers.",,,
nom_leaf,SHIP,"This mini vessel is a throwback to the Domain exploration days when automated fleets explored the galaxy, gathering spaceborne materials for the construction and maintenance of probe swarms deployed to survey planetary bodies at each new star system. The lack of life-support permits the Leaf to be cheaply made while still sporting a fully-kitted surveying equipment. A nominal pair of fighter-grade masers is included, but the drone is otherwise meant to stay out of combat.

Practical use aside, this floral creation is technically a jump-capable, armed, fully-autonomous drone. The combination violates a large swathe of sector regulations, and given the Nomad's insistence on its continual deployment, does risk triggering factional conflict with legitimate causus-belli. Ironically perhaps, since a number of designs in circulation tecitly avoid the issue by, e.g., slaving the drone to a human-piloted frigate. Rumors even say that Captain <REDACTED>, who commanded the original scavenger fleet that the Nomads hailed as they entered this sector, received a Leaf in honor of the meeting. She managed to narrowly skirt Hegemony censure by bolting a shuttle onto the drone spine, connecting the navigation systems together, then proceeding to insist that the vessel is now a piloted ship (no doubt with a bribe or two along the way). Where this bold chap or her unique prize currently sides, few can say, but the moral of the story is evidently about the continuing taboo surrounding over-automation.",,,
nom_tortoise,SHIP,"Functionally a standard cargo hauler, except following the Nomad style of directly bolting containers to the ship spine without bothering with superfluous protections such as a hull. The advent of shields and lack of piracy outside inhabited systems has meant that Nomads could afford to conduct logistics directly in space - with the odd loss to a stray asteroid or two.

Container specifications have not changed significantly since the last galactic-wide standardisation attempt by the Domain of Man, which in turn was based on pre-historical conventions. For this reason few modifications were required by the Oasis fleet in order to conduct trade, except in rare cases such as the live transport of Volturnian Lobsters - it is surprisingly difficult to reliably maintain a significant liquid water environment against the harshness of space.",,
nom_cactus,SHIP,"Functionally a standard fuel tanker - and essentially identical to sector equivalents. The Nomads utilise a small number of swappable universal-size pods that greatly simplifies the refuelling of larger ships in the fleet. The practice can be seen most obviously on the racks aboard Nomad capitals such as the Gila Monster, partially hidden by removable armor plating.",,,
nom_yellowjacket,SHIP,"The single, devastating sniper maser equipped on the Yellowjacket seems to be the best Nomads could do to stretch the range-limitations of maser technology. The cost of overspecialization is fairly extreme - the extensive support systems required to operate this stallion renders the rest of the Yellowjacket's performance profiles rather feeble. To make an analogy to existing sector doctrine, Yellowjackets are similar to Vigilences and press-ganged Hounds in their fleet-support roles. Its principle value to the Nomad arsenal is the addition of ranged firepower otherwise lacking in frontline ships, which greatly eases the difficulty Nomad fleets have when dealing with technologically superior opponents.

The lack of such sniper masers in other Nomad shipspecs reinforces the hypothesis that the research-direction is ultimately a dead-end,ultimately supplanted by the broader utility of massed fusion torpedoes.",,,
nom_death_bloom,SHIP,"Death-blooms are a relatively rare sight due to their expensive (in Nomad terms) manufacture and maintenance profile. Its signature weapon is the Solar Crucible, a fusion-powered beam weapon engineered specifically to slice through armor plating in contrast with the Nomad norm of general-purpose Electron Masers. Also strange is the inclusion of a Domain-compatible energy mount capable of interfacing modern weapons with the ancient Naeran flux shunt configurations. Together with their fast and sleek profile, the established presence of Death-blooms in an otherwise low-tech faction strongly suggests that contact was not completely broken between their disappearance from Domain space and the Collapse.

If so, it is almost certain that the same contacts forwarded Tritachyon shield technology now retrofitted on all Nomad ships. The shielding characteristics,as well as marginal compatibility with both Domain-standard weapons and modspecs, all point towards a recent influx of technology that the Nomads are struggling to incorporate into their existing assets. <REST OF ENTRY REDACTED>",,,
nom_flycatcher,SHIP,"The Flycatcher ultralight carrier presents a strong case for Nomad ingenuity and refinement of venerable technologies. Few others could boast of what they have achieved: a fully-functioning strikecraft platform that could both match burns with the fastest frigate as well as somewhat defend itself in combat against opposing military ships. A tag-team of Flycatchers and combat frigates can thus outgun most equivalent fleets, then outrun heavier response fleets.

The Flycatcher's combination of speed and flexibility presents a pipedream for privateers, and a nightmare scenario for strategic commands of resident powers. If sufficiently antagonized, the Oasis fleet itself can theoretically resort to guerrilla warfare against the outer reaches of core systems by scattering fleets across multiple trade lanes. The imagined threat alone of inbound Flycatcher killteams would likely extirpate mid-sized trading within the local region and potentially even hamper black-market trade. This potential outcome has contributed to the current studious neutrality of planet-bound factions towards the Nomads, at least until counter-measures could be devised.",,,
nom_komodo,SHIP,"Now that the Nomads have returned to colonized space, their Komodo-class destroyers have regained the dubious honor of being the most ancient military shipspecs still in active service - taking over from a number of militarized Colossus loadouts testified in early Domain records. Similar to almost all descendant Nomad designs, the Mark-I Komodo chassis employs streamlined manufacture that features built-in weapon emplacements and protection via patchworks of heavy armor covering the blackened internal hull. This renders the entire Nomad navy tactically inflexible and somewhat less durable compared to familiar Domain designs based on mount systems and uniformly-welded plating. However, repair to the Nomads can be as simple as detach-and-replace even when undergoing interstellar travel, which in the context of post-Collapse history is certainly an innovation over our millenia-bred dependence on Domain shipyard autofacs.

The first confident records of Komodos attest their use as heavy escorts in larger trade convoys, taking over from the militarized civilian and obsolete military hulls that probably accompanied the initial Nomad expedition. Then as now, Komodos were equipped with a decent mix of light and medium weapons to engage or chase-off smaller opponents. Their age and obsolescence begins to show against modern, dedicated military destroyers - where without additional support a Komodo can at best attempt to out-flux its opponent in a direct grind.

In the current context of the Oasis fleet and their lack of a dedicated transport, civil duties are being performed by Mark-I Komodos and Flycatchers supplemented by various frigates. It is perhaps ironic that the original escorts have essentially become the escorted today.",,,
nom_komodo_mk2,SHIP,"The Mark-II improvement of the venerable Komodo turns an escort into a dedicated military vessel by trading a significant proportion of engine capability for heavier masers plus much-improved flux dissipation. The overall result leads to a ship that in expert hands can match an assault Sunder in terms of sheer aggression, and perhaps even come out slightly ahead in a suicidal charge. Given the ability of Nomads to improvise and improve, one should not mistake the apparent obsolescence of their ships for weakness.",,,
nom_komodo_p,SHIP,"This Komodo hull was likely left derelict in space; a resourceful individual has ressurected it and restored it to some semblance of operational status. However, it lacks some of the key technology common to all Naeran ship construction, so readily-available parts have been substituted in certain places or bolted on, and Naeran weapons are no longer compatible with it.",,,
nom_roadrunner,SHIP,"The Roadrunner is a curious vessel. It is best described as a destroyer-sized interceptor - essentially a pair of unique, massive engines that are thinly wrapped by the rest of the ship. These beasts give Roadrunners powerful and sustained thrust both in and out of battle, compared to the short bursts employed by burn drives in the Domain doctrine. This characteristic would've made the Nomad invention highly sought after by mining and construction guilds, if only they returned in more civil times. Instead, it now propels an otherwise mediocre combat ship dedicated to interdiction and pursuit duties with an efficiency rivaling that of legendary Tritachyon Tempests.

Also of note is built-in pulse EMP weapons not used elsewhere in the Nomad fleet. These make flanking Roadrunners doubly terrifying if left to their own devices.",,,
nom_scorpion,SHIP,"Specialized long-range missile support destroyers are an oddity in a navy seemingly dedicated to flux-frenzied frontal attacks, and all the more due to the nature of fusion torpedoes employed by Nomads as slow-drifting energy warheads. The Scorpion destroyer was likely invented as a backup-plan against opposing forces with superior shielding technology where constant offensive pressure would be required to support the main Nomad assault. The tactic is clearly similar to Salamanders and Pilums missiles, but with the relative inefficiency of such a slow warhead against point-defense a large number of torpedoes are required.

Moreover, instead of spreading out the required munitions to mount a missile death-ball across multiple frigates (in the style of Domain Vigilances), the Nomads instead stacks as many fusion torpedoes as possible onto a single destroyer chassis. As a result, the Scorpion resembles a flying sensor array and probably twice as fragile. Only the reckless would be willing to pilot this deathtrap without serious protection against marauding frigate teams.",,,
nom_rattlesnake,SHIP,"The Rattlesnake is a decent, all-around heavy cruiser designed to absorb punishment and dish it out with equal ferocity. It is without a doubt slow, moving with a reptilian patience - but most deadly to opponents straying within reach of maser range. Given the uniqueness of maser weaponry where range and efficiency paradoxically increases with mount size, the reach of Rattlesnakes are greater than that of Nomad midline destroyers even without accounting for the strikecraft they deploy. This makes flanking an optimal tactic when combating such larger Nomad vessels.

Recent (experimental) updates to the shipspec feature a small number of domain-compatible mounts, indicating the Nomad's eagerness to adopt current sector technology. This is a dangerous sign, for the faction is currently hindered by their lack of weapon diversity. Given our broad availability of powerful late-Domain technologies that can compensate for their stupendously flux-inefficient masers, the Nomad fleet may in the near future transform into a great terror of the sector if allowed to freely trade.

As a side note, all Nomad assets of cruiser or greater size are some form of military-civilian hybrids, rendering them more massive and less maneuverable than sector counter-parts. The potential implications of this should not be underestimated in the event of hostilities, as the Nomads don't always evacuate non-combat personnel before combat. It is ..interesting that such a spaceborne civilization would eschew separation of peace and war assets, although perhaps Nomads are more limited by mechanical maintenance than by human lives in this regard.",,,
nom_sandstorm,SHIP,"This ship named for its sheer frontal firepower capable of dissolving all but the heaviest capitals in a storm of red-white fury, and also for the relative brevity at which such a display can be sustained. The Sandstorm shines in the center of pitched battle, protected on both flanks as it cycles between devouring frontline opponents and combating its own enormous flux usage - and the significant downtime highlights just how outmatched the flux dissipators are against the input produced by its numerous maser mounts. The intimidating display and reputation means that Sandstorms are often found spearheading major Nomad offensives, as the largest Nomad asset opposing forces will likely see outside of home defense. Much like the Hegemony Onslaughts, defeating these in battle will require careful stripping of its escorts followed by a concerted attack from multiple fronts.

Surprisingly, a small civilian hold does exist within the bowels of this beast, nestled within one of the two wing structures with the other dedicated to storage. Perhaps a sane person would think twice about taking up residence in a ship built to conduct suicidal charges. However, considering the ever-present danger and general paucity of housing associated with space-borne civilization, the meter-thick armor plating protecting these decks offer significant consolation. In any case, a concerted attack strong enough to defeat a Sandstorm would probably also pose a grave threat to the entire Nomad fleet that Sandstorms are usually guarding. Should that happen, unless one is amongst the fortunate on the Oasis itself the choice of other abodes doesn't really matter.",,,
nom_queen_bee,SHIP,"While classed as an attack carrier, the Queen Bee serves more comfortably as the centerpiece of a fleet, securing a zone of space superiority in which allied ships can be well-protected. This ability stems mostly from its dedication towards supporting and refreshing the six fighter wings - the presence of two fusion torpedo batteries serving more as a distraction aid than the shield-piercing armaments commonly equipped on sector capital-class carriers. This is not to say that the Queen Bee is poorly armed; as fitting of Nomad doctrine, its frontal profile bristles with maser mounts and can be covered by its concentrated shield-arc. Direct one-on-one confrontations should be avoided at all costs.

The first sightings of these behemoth vessels drew a surprising amount of scorn from sector elites, earning disparaging comments such as comparisons to hollowed industrial asteroids and other similar mentions of aesthetics (offending especially the Tritachyon enthusiasts). What they could not disparage was the carriers' purported capabilities. Most of all, the surprising creature comforts offered to fighter crew as part of the Queen Bee's civilian functions: a Nomad industrial center. For carrier captains with a soul for his crew, as well as most fodder pilots across the sector, this luxury is the stuff of dreams. One could also guess that the Nomads value individual lives more carefully than us, as a consequence of their more fragile existence.",,,
nom_gila_monster,SHIP,"Although history has consistently depicted Nomads as a people who shun all-out warfare, there have been times when they were forced to tackle existential threats in the form of Domain warfleets headed by the largest and most powerful ships then known in the galaxy. It is for these eventualities that the Gila Monster was created, functioning as honor guards and civilian centers of the Oasis fleet(s) unless circumstances compel their deployment in battle - that is, against opposing capital ships even more powerful than the military-focused Sandstorms. In more colloquial terms, Gila Monsters are literally the kitchen sink and weapon of final resort; its appearance signals the Nomad's willingness to risk a core piece of their infrastructure to achieve victory.

The unique dual-nature of Nomad cruisers and capitals are easier to understand in the context of the necessities of nomadic life. Without consistent access to surface or orbital facilities, this civilization cannot afford to sustain a large number of capital vessels. The assets that they do have likely reflect the maintenance limits imposed by the Oasis with additional resources supplied via scavenging battlefield debris. Thus, the bustling of the small city deep within is powered by the same extensive and complex flux circuitry as that used by its Doom Cannon. The jostling of taxi drones and assault bombers for available docks is a rare sight elsewhere in the sector, but found here on the expansive bow flight decks. The thorough mixture of war and peace functions could easily confuse a visitor into thinking that Nomads possess a spartan philosophy of complete mobilisation, were they not also aware of the Oasis.

The Gila in battle relies upon its centerpiece Doom Cannon to pin down enemy capitals and annihilate them while supported by myriad smaller masers and strikecraft. Despite this,the ship is undoubtedly defensive in nature: the Cannon has limited charges, the masers are weak but well-distributed, and the ship is ponderously immobile,which is a stark contrast to the slightly smaller Sandstorm. This renders the Gila relatively inefficient at tackling frigates and destroyer swarms, although far better at surviving them. A number of theorists have proposed that a completely militarized version of the Gila is possible by stripping out the civilian core for additional infrastructure and strikecraft capacity, resulting in an Astral-Onslaught hybrid although not necessarily more powerful. One hopes never to find out.",,,
nom_oasis,SHIP,"The Oasis is as unique as any ship can be when cobbled together without a shipspec, and even more so after an uncountable number of repairs and modifications accumulated throughout its service. Although several conflicting origin-legends exist, a commonly accepted story is that a similar venerable juggernaut saw its beginnings as one of the Nomads' foolhardy welding experiment: a fusion between a ring habitat, a trade station, and an asteroid pusher that was lucky enough to survive its maiden jump thanks to frantic repair and ingenious improvisation. The uncanny resemblance of this Oasis to that fairytale, along with the rest of the iconic fleet and culture, is sufficient proof for many that its occupants are truly who they claim to be, rather than usurpers on some grand and unfathomable hoax.

No short summary can fully capture the centrality of the Oasis to every aspect of its host Nomad civilization - functioning as their home in all possible senses. The ship is a mobile, miniaturized space station that enables its accompanying fleet to journey endlessly around the galaxy, pausing only to gather the raw materials necessary for on-site fuel and supply replenishment.  The raw industrial muscle occurs astern, along a central spine studded portside by fuel and storage capsules. The starboard side is left open as an external working space for meticulously arranged autofacs and drone ports, permitting fabrication of ship parts up to an entire frigate. The bow section is devoted to the living and governing of Nomad society, dominated by a rotating biosphere surrounded by densely packed civilian decks in total accommodating upwards of ten thousand passengers. The agriculture, nursery, and leisure livelihoods contained in this microenvironment are reminiscent of planet-side life, thus anchoring each Nomad to their ancient origins on fabled Earth. Given the size and isolation, the biodiversity of all species including the Nomads themselves are presumably supplemented by genebanks to guard against catastrophic collapse.

On a darker note, the apparent ability for any single ship to shoulder alone the demands of a civilization implies superhuman agency. Each type of Domain-era space facility - be it habitat, mining, administrative, or research - employs an entire team of gamma-class AI chips to operate specialized tasks. This ship appears to function in all roles simultaneously, the coordination of which is beyond human comprehension let alone the myriad skills and knowledge required. As the Oasis continues to demonstrate these capabilities on its sector-wide tour, the question haranguing faction analysts is no longer whether there are governing agents onboard, but how complex it or they are and their relationship with the human... tenants. <FURTHER ANALYSIS REDACTED>",,,
nom_planet_naera,CUSTOM,"Naera is an oddity among habitable planets. It is a poor candidate for colonization due to its immense size, low density atmosphere and high surface temperature. Despite these difficulties a bold group of ancient pre-travel-drive explorers wound up in orbit around Naera. Their cryo-preservation systems had failed on a mission to another planet and they were forced to take refuge there. Using the remains of their vessel and technology, they settled on the surface and gradually adapted to its extreme conditions. This civilization eventually returned to the stars and earned themselves the title ""Nomads.""  They now spend most of their time off-planet, only to occasionally return during times of critical emergency.",,,
nomads,FACTION,"Across the eons, only a small fraction of humanity have seriously contemplated trading an anchored life for an endless journey. Regardless of whether the choice was between a house and the roads, or a planet and the stars, people have generally preferred the stability of a sedentary life over one spent wandering through the vastness of Creation. Home was a concept rooted on firm ground, and even the most adventurous of pirates would find tempting the prospect of retirement into some freeport cartel. After all, who would tell their stories if they died ignominiously in some forgotten corner of the sector?

To those bitten with wanderlust, however, hyperspace travel was the ultimate gateway drug. One group of these minorities came to be called the Nomads - simply named due to the sheer age of their distinct civilization relative to all other nomadic splinters. The Nomads' origin stretches before even the Domain of Man, when according to legend hyperspace was pierced by bright and colorful trails - outpacing the rudimentary droneships exploring the neighborhood of fabled Earth. A fleet of ill-fitted ships departed the cradle of humanity for the unknown expanse, carrying explorers who were driven to see the galaxy for themselves and who could not endure being spoilered by blurred hypercomm images. Neither the destination of this first fleet nor the names of their crew are now knowable,and given the dangers of hyperspace to long-term health unknown to the initial explorers, the present civilization is most likely descended from later participants during the initial Domain epoch rather than the original fleet. Nevertheless, their indomitable spirit remains within all those who now call the Oasis fleet home.

Based on their current state, the initial Nomad fleet likely maintained sporadic contact with early Domain settlers then gradually broke off as the frontiers became increasingly militarized. The inexorable exploitation of both planet and people drove the Nomads away from colonized space, and were it not for the Collapse they would probably have never returned. At least, this is what the Oasis fleet claims after it emerged within hyperspace sensors and established contact with a thoroughly dumbfounded scavenger fleet. It seems that the Nomads became aware of the calamity - and then became curious of what had befallen humanity as each sector was left to fend for itself. The fleet currently tours this sector, mining resources from unclaimed planets and conducting restricted trade with the major factions, all the while maintaining respectable distance from population centers. A small outpost has even been established in a minor system, raising the suspicious eyebrows of many Hegemony and Tri-tachyon security officers.
